1st Group Project in Quad 2 created 4 November 2016

GENERAL USAGE NOTES:
--------------------
This was a weekend project designed, built, and deployed to cloud services from scratch.

-The user is also able to jump to a particular president by entering in their term number.

-Each page displays the Presidents' name, image, term number, political party, dates in office, and a fun fact.

-The user can also search the list by typing in letters or words for the first name, last name, political party, and fun facts.

-Finally, the user can return to the original list of Presidents by clicking the home button.
